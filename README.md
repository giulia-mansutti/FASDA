# FASDA
Full-field Amplitude Speckle Decorrelation Angiography (FASDA) [1]

-------------------------------------

We provide two scripts to process two datasets acquired from a dysplastic nevus (one with parallel, one with crossed polarizers):

1. "FASDAanalysis_DysplasticNevus_parallelPolarizers.m" to process the dataset acquired with parallel polarizers
2. "FASDAanalysis_DysplasticNevus_crossedPolarizers.m"  to process the dataset acquired with crossed polarizers


Follow these steps to run the two scripts:

1. Download the two zip files containing the datasets provided in [1]

2. Unzip the downladed zip files and move the two uncompressed folders ("Parallel Polarizers" and "Crossed Polarizers") into the "Data" folder located in the main FASDA folder (where the scripts are located)

2. Run the script of interest (one of the two listed above)

3. The results are saved into the "Output" folder
